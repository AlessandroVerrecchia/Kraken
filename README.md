Display infinite jokes form https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api and random pictures from https://picsum.photos 

This was a code test i had fun making !

Built with Kotlin.
I used : coroutines and live data for everything async, mvvm architecture, textToSpeach, and pagination for "infinite scrolling"
